<p>For the current version (which you can also edit) of the user Guide where you can add information, check out our <a href="https://github.com/iLanguage/AndroidAuBlog/wiki/" target="_blank">Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>AuBlog has three main screens</p>
<img src="mainmenu.png" width="100"/>

<ol>
<li> View Drafts Tree
</li>
<li> Edit Blog Entry
</li>
<li> Settings


</li>
</ol> AuBlog lets you draft blog entries in two ways

<ul>
<li> Traditional Blog Client: typing, editing, saving, typing some more
</li>
<li> Blog/Podcast Client: speaking, listening, revising and speaking again


</li>
</ul><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="wiki-1_View_Drafts_Tree_Screen"><a name="wiki-1_View_Drafts_Tree_Screen">1. View Drafts Tree Screen</a></span></h3>

<img src="draftstree.png" width="100"/>
<p>On this screen you can navigate your previous blog posts (published and unpublished). Instead of a list of drafts, its presented as a tree so that when you change your post, a new "daughter" is saved under that post. It might be confusing when you start, but it can also be really helpful to "rewind" to a previous version, or to start a new direction off the same post. AuBlog starts with some sample entries so you can see what the Drafts Tree looks like.</p>

<p>The Tree shape is probably most useful if you are blogging via speaking. Sometimes you listen to what you recorded and you decide "branch" out in another direction. This is why a tree is more useful than a list.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="wiki-2_Edit_Blog_Entry_Screen"><a name="wiki-2_Edit_Blog_Entry_Screen">2. Edit Blog Entry Screen</a></span></h3>


<img src="editUseViaRecording.png" width="100"/>
<p>On this screen you can type (or use Google Voice to dictate sentence by sentence). This is basically the same interface that you would have on any other Android Blogger client. You can use WYSIWYG editing by selecting text then clicking on the buttons to make it bold, underlined etc. To preview the marked-up version, click on the Preview button with the green checkmark. It will open up the preview pane below the edit area.</p>

<p>The Edit screen also lets you record long dictations. The dictations are saved in an audio folder on the SDCARD so that your thoughts don't "disappear into thin air." You can listen to them again, or do with them as you wish. (Go to the Settings screen to Open the audio folder). AuBlog attaches them to the draft tree so that you can listen to your drafts in the order of their "family tree".</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="wiki-3_Settings_Screen"><a name="wiki-3_Settings_Screen">3. Settings Screen</a></span></h3>


<img src="settings.png" width="100"/>
<p>On this screen you can add your Blogger account so that you can publish your blog entries. On the settings screen you also have other options like exporting your drafts, turning Text to Speech (TTS) on or off. AuBlog can read your blog entries to you when you click saveif you are) this way you can use AuBlog "eyes free" when its difficult to look at the screen (while walking, in direct sunlight etc).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="wiki-How_to_get_the_most_out_of_AuBlog"><a name="wiki-How_to_get_the_most_out_of_AuBlog">How to get the most out of AuBlog</a></span></h2>

<p>AuBlog is designed to take notes while you are somewhere with no internet connection (ie, can't use Google Voice for dictation), and you want to build towards a new blog entry, or work on many entries concurrently. You might never publish some of those drafts, but you always have access to them. (There's a button to email your drafts to yourself, or export them in the Settings so that you don't lose your thoughts if you lose your Android or you stop using AuBlog).</p>

<p>Ideally AuBlog is designed to help you go from Notes to Blog + Podcast with minimal typing. AuBlog wants to transcribe your dictations for you so that you have the least amount of typing to do. Currently this is only possible by sending the audio to a server, and getting back some transcriptions. We are working to integrate a couple of Open Source projects to make this work on the phone itself, but be for-warned, you will still have to do some corrections to make the transcription actually match what you said. Usually these machine transcriptions aren't that good. If we have enough demand we can make it possible for you to hire a human to transcribe your audio for you (the usual rate for most transcription services is 1$ per minute), but that is for future releases if we get enough interest!</p>
